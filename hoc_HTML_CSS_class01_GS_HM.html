        <p>Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by Matthew Perry. He was born on January 8, 1968, to Nora Tyler Bing (Morgan Fairchild), a romance novelist, and Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), a gay female impersonator who later had a sex change operation and became the star of a Las Vegas drag show called “Viva Las Gay-gas”. He is of Scottish and Swedish ancestry. He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family. Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood. It is revealed in season 1 he went to an all-boys high school.</p>
